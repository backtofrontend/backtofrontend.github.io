### About the platform; Office 365

Office 365 has the latest teamwork, productivity, and security controls that combine the intelligence of the **cloud** and **AI** to help facilitate innovation. With Office 365 a role in IT can give more critical and time-saving capabilities to end users, as well as to people in security, compliance, and development.

> Office 365 is poised by the degree of automation that exists within the service, the invaluable insight to network events, and the sophisticated methods of monitoring used to detect problems.

The platform that Office 365 is, consists of a set of **cloud services** (workloads), available in over _181 countries_ around the world. And the interconnection between different workloads is what makes it unique.

### What is a cloud service in laymans terms?

A cloud service is just a resource delivered over the Internet. The idea being that customers can transfer the burden for running workloads on servers installed within their own premises to a cloud provider. The provider charges a subscription fee based on some unit of work. And the value proposition is that the big economy of scale created by cloud providers allows them to deliver the same or better functionality at a lower cost than is possible for on-prem IT to deliver. As more users move to the cloud, the economics improve, which then lets providers enhance and grow their services.

### On Microsoft datacenters

Microsoft organizes their datacenters into different regions where Office 365 tenants share a single large logical infrastructure composed of hundreds of thousands of servers. The datacenter region selected to host the data for new tenants is based on the country selected by the tenant. They have built out the Office 365 datacenter infrastructure with the intention of keeping data as local as possible to satisfy local regulations and accommodate customer choice.
