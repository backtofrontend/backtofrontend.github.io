### About the Platform; Office 365

Office 365 is like the Big Boss. It is the main platform which kindles innovation with modern productivity, teamwork, and security features. A combination of **A**rtificial **I**ntelligence stirred with the magic of the **cloud**. Office 365 allows the end-users critical and timesaving potentials. It’s poised by automation that exists within the service, the invaluable insight to network events, and the mature methods of monitoring needed to detect problems. That vast collection of **cloud services** is available in many countries over the world. And what makes it unique is the connection between them.

### What is a Cloud Service in Layman Terms?

A cloud service is a resource delivered over the Internet with a subscription fee based on some unit of work. For their customers, a cloud provider takes on the burden for running workloads. The economy of scale created by the providers allows them to deliver the same or better functionality at a low cost. And, as more users move to the cloud, it allows for further enhancement and growth of their services.

### Microsoft Data Centers

Microsoft has data centers established in different regions where Office 365 tenants share one big logical infrastructure comprising hundreds of thousands of servers. They attempt to keep the data as local as possible to satisfy local regulations and adapt to customer preference.

**Security is of key concern** and Microsoft pays a lot of attention to the _physical security_ of the buildings and _cyber-security_ for the data stored within. As the infrastructure is continually growing, even though the live location for tenant data changes, the users can continue to work and access their information from anywhere around the globe.

### Microsoft 365 Roadmap and Constant Changes

So considering that the software running inside Office 365 is under a **constant state of change** and _additional features_ keep pouring in. Things differ from the traditional model where software releases often appear on an annual release cycle. And that can be a challenge, but it is the method used by most major cloud services.

The changes range from minor tweaks to introducing an additional feature that could change the behavior of an app. And the best way to stay in the loop is to monitor the [Microsoft 365 Roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=O365).

It details things coming to Enterprise Mobility & Security, Office 365, and Windows 10. It is being updated regularly, and its contents will allow the consumers to plan for the new behavior.
