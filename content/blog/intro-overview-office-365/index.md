Office 365 has the latest teamwork, productivity, and security controls that combine the intelligence of the cloud and AI to help instrument innovation. With Office 365 a role in IT can deliver more critical and time-saving capabilities to end users, as well as to people in security, compliance, and developer roles.

A cloud service is a resource delivered over the Internet, including software resources (Software as a service, or SaaS) or infrastructure (Infrastructure as a Service, or IaaS). The idea behind cloud services is that customers can transfer the burden for running workloads on servers installed within their own premises to a cloud provider, who then charges a subscription fee based on some unit of work. The value proposition is that the massive economy of scale created by cloud providers allows them to deliver the same or better functionality at a lower cost than is possible for on-prem IT to deliver. As more users move to the cloud, the economics improve, which then lets providers enhance and grow their services.
