### About the Platform; Office 365

**Office 365** is like the Big Boss. It is THE platform which kindles innovation, with modern productivity, teamwork, and security features. A combination of **AI** stirred with the magic of the **cloud**. Office 365 allows the end-users critical and timesaving potentials. It’s poised by intelligent automation that exists within the service, the invaluable insight to network events, and the mature methods of monitoring needed to detect problems.

Credit goes to all the apps that make Office 365 what it is; including SharePoint and Exchange Online, Skype for Business, Planner, Yammer, Groups, Teams, OneDrive and a handful of others. That vast collection of **cloud services** is available in many countries over the world. And what makes it unique is the harmony between them.

### So What is a Cloud Service Anyway?

A cloud service is a resource delivered over the Internet with a subscription fee based on some unit of work. For their customers, a cloud provider takes on the burden for running workloads. The grand economy, created by the providers, allows them to deliver the same or better functionality at a low cost. And, as more users move to the cloud, it allows for further enhancement and growth of their services.

### On Microsoft Data Centers

Microsoft has data centers established in different regions where Office 365 tenants share one big logical infrastructure comprising hundreds of thousands of servers. They attempt to keep the data as local as possible to adapt to customer preference and accommodate any regulations.

**Security is of key concern** and Microsoft pays a lot of attention to the _physical security_ of the locations and _cyber-security_ for the data stored within. As the infrastructure is continually growing, the live location for tenant data varies. But the users still have uninterrupted access to their information, allowing them to work from anywhere around the globe.

### Microsoft 365 Roadmap and Constant Changes

So considering that the software running inside Office 365 is under a **constant state of change** and _additional features_ keep pouring in. Things differ from the traditional model. Where software releases might appear on an annual release cycle. And that can be a challenge, but it is the method used by most leading cloud services.

The changes range from minor tweaks to introducing an additional feature that could change the behavior of an app. And the best way to stay in the loop is to monitor the [Microsoft 365 Roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=O365).

It details things coming to _Enterprise Mobility & Security_, **Office 365**, and _Windows 10_. It is being updated regularly, and its contents will allow the consumers to plan for the novel behavior.

### And What of the Competition?

We know competition is healthy for consumers and the proper driver of innovation. So who keeps pushing Microsoft to up their game constantly? It’s none other than Google with its **G Suite**.

And though Google’s strength lies in the _small to medium space_, and Microsoft’s is dominating the _enterprise_. Google still has a tremendous influence over the development of Office 365 and has set many standards we expect today’s cloud applications to live up to.

While it’s not easy to compare each company's subscription plans, they both have good **desktop** (_browser_) and **mobile support** for their apps. Both of them support offline access to a degree. Both provide migration tools to help companies move data into the cloud. Although Microsoft supports hybrid environments, designed to allow enterprises to keep some services on their premises. Or to allow verging their data to the cloud.

But there are still incomparable advantages to using one rather than the other. Google might have the edge (pun intended) over the fact that all their apps are cloud based and work well together from the start. But then, Microsoft has wonderful automation features with its PowerShell scripting and APIs for data available through different endpoints. And so on and so forth.

And we have to consider the cost per user per month, which will surely be a decider for some customers. Eventually it will all come down to your specific needs.
